# Angular 7 and PHP File Upload Example


In this tutorial, you'll learn how you can upload files in your PHP web application. We'll not use any framework but plain PHP.

Next, we'll see how we can use Angular 7 to create a frontend that provides a form for uploading an image file to the backend using `FormData` and `HttpClient`. We'll be also looking at how to create a reactive form with Angular.
